  "essay": "Hunter Henry scored twenty-five points. Let that marinate. For two solid weeks \u2014 and one very pointed preseason essay \u2014 this column had one recurring message for the Legion of Bouz: Mahomes and ARSB deserve a tight end with a pulse. The group chat agreed. The models agreed. The roster screamed it. And then Week 3 happened, and Hunter Henry \u2014 the tight end who was supposedly the roster\u2019s fatal flaw \u2014 went off for 25.0, anchoring a 191.34-point explosion that crowned the Legion as the league\u2019s new number one.\n\n{{media:week3-essay-opener}}\n\nThe irony would be delicious if it weren\u2019t so humbling. But Hunter Henry\u2019s resurrection wasn\u2019t even the most absurd stat of the week. That honor belongs to the Minnesota Vikings defense, which dropped 35.0 points for the Boonist Monks \u2014 the single highest individual performance in the entire league \u2014 and the Monks still lost. Lamar Jackson added 27.02, James Cook rolled for 19.3, and the final tally read 166.82 points... for a loss. Because the Legion had 191.34. The preseason dead-last-to-number-one fairy tale just hit its first plot twist, and the group chat is scrambling to update its power-rankings discourse for the third consecutive week.\n\nLast week\u2019s \u201cThings I Believe But Can\u2019t Prove\u201d predicted that Father Time would win four straight starting in Week 3. Father Time scored 105.22 \u2014 the lowest total in the league \u2014 and lost to the Sleeping Giants by 38.42 points. The four-game win streak lasted approximately negative one games. We stand by nothing.\n\n{{media:week3-prediction-bust}}\n\nKittler on the Roof reminded everyone that defending champions don\u2019t need drama \u2014 just Jonathan Taylor\u2019s 31.3-point masterclass and a 40.2-point demolition of Rasheeing the Scene that felt like the final act of a John Wick film: methodical, overwhelming, no survivors. Three teams sit unbeaten at 3-0 \u2014 the Legion, Kittler, and General Ken-obi \u2014 and two of them weren\u2019t even in the preseason top five. The pecking order is crystallizing, and it looks nothing like what we predicted in August.\n\nMHJTIME, the league\u2019s points leader through two weeks, crashed back to earth with 113.92 \u2014 a 68.88-point nosedive from last week\u2019s 182.8. The historic WR trio? None of them cracked the top five scorers. Instead, Quinshon Judkins (16.0) and Daniel Jones (15.82) led the way. When your backup quarterback is your second-highest scorer, the group chat doesn\u2019t need to roast you. The stat line does it for free.\n\nThe bottom of the standings is hardening. Three teams sit at 0-3 \u2014 Father Time, Chudders, and Burden of Etienne-y Woody \u2014 and the paths diverge sharply. Chudders is playing for 2026 with a war chest of picks; the losing was always part of the plan. Burden has Justin Jefferson and still can\u2019t crack 134 points. The franchise player hasn\u2019t led his own team\u2019s scoring all season, and the trade whispers are becoming trade plans.\n\nOn the upside, the Sleeping Giants quietly bounced back from last week\u2019s six-spot tumble with a 143.64-point performance. Jalen Hurts\u2019 29.04 was a full redemption tour after his 10.54 disaster in Week 2. The Giants are now 8-0 all-time against Father Time \u2014 a head-to-head record so lopsided it deserves its own entry in the Jailyard Bible.\n\nThree weeks in. Three undefeated. Three winless. Six teams in the messy middle. And the question that will define the next month: which of these narratives are real, and which ones are just noise?",

The 40.2-point loss was the biggest margin of defeat this week, and it\u2019s worth noting that your preseason essay warned about this exact profile: weekly thrill rides that occasionally crash into a guardrail. Two-and-one with 423.6 total points is respectable, but your Elo took a 17.1-point hit, and Michael Pittman (16.3) being your fourth-highest scorer speaks to the WR depth problem we\u2019ve been flagging since August.

The preseason ranked you eleventh and said your veterans were on borrowed time. At 2-1, the loan has been extended. You rode Hurts and a deep backfield to the 2024 final, and three weeks into 2025, the formula looks familiar: let Hurts cook, grind with the running backs, and hope the receivers hold together long enough to make noise.
