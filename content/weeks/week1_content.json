  "essay": "Derrick Henry rushed for 28.7 points in Week 1. He is thirty-one years old. He has more than 2,000 career carries. He was supposed to be the cautionary tale, the guy we pointed to when we warned Sleeping Giants that Father Time was undefeated. Instead, he dragged zbcowan's squad to 151.48 points and the number-one power ranking in the league. The preseason number-eleven team. Sitting at the top. If this were a movie, it would be the opening scene of Rocky Balboa where everyone assumes he's washed and then he starts punching meat again.\n\nMeanwhile, in a quieter corner of the scoreboard, Josh Allen dropped 38.76 points for Rasheeing the Scene — the kind of performance that makes you whisper to yourself, 'Maybe this is the year he finally gets a real receiver corps.' He won't. But for one Sunday, it didn't matter. Allen outscored entire teams by himself, and ToreroGaucho rode that lightning to a comfortable win over Noble FFT, whose preseason number-two ranking suddenly looks like the kind of projection that ages like milk left on a Houston porch in August.\n\nThe group chat was uncharacteristically quiet for about forty-five minutes after the Boonist Monks dropped 144.36 on Ghastly Grayskull Gang. Not quiet in the respectful way — quiet in the 'nobody wants to be the first to say it' way. Lamar Jackson went for 29.36, James Cook added 18.7, and GrayskullXX's roster responded with a collective shrug and 109.42 points. The preseason number-four team posted the week's lowest score. Somewhere, a mountain of draft picks weeps silently.\n\nBut here's the storyline nobody's talking about yet: the preseason top three — General Ken-obi, Noble FFT, and MHJTIME — went a combined 1-2 in Week 1. Only bLaker24 escaped with a win, and even that felt muted: 135.88 points against a Father Time squad that could only muster 120.68. CeeDee Lamb contributed 14.5 and Saquon added 16.4, which is fine, but 'fine' doesn't win you championships. It wins you Tuesday morning nods in the group chat.\n\nMHJTIME scored 142.62 points and still lost. Read that again. In most weeks, against most teams, that's a win. But rango_ drew Sleeping Giants in Week 1, and Derrick Henry and Jalen Hurts combined for 52.98 points. That's the kind of beat that would make you close your fantasy app and open a meditation app instead. The worst part? We wrote in the preseason that MHJTIME's running backs were 'patchwork.' Turns out, scoring 142 doesn't matter when your opponent's running backs remember what decade they peaked in and decide to do it again.\n\nKittler on the Roof handled business against Chudders, 143.72 to 133.82. The defending champion didn't need fireworks — Garrett Wilson and Puka Nacua combined for 37.1 points at receiver, and the defense carried the rest. Consistency. That's the Kittler brand. We said in the preseason that your floor was 'nice but your ceiling might be drywall.' Week 1 was drywall. Winning drywall, but drywall.\n\nOne week in and the entire preseason hierarchy is scrambled. The bottom two preseason teams sit in the top four. The consensus top two both lost. This is dynasty football. This is The Jailyard. Buckle your seatbelt — we've got thirteen more weeks of this before anyone clinches anything.",

Your 151.48 points led the league. Jalen Hurts is a cheat code, your three-headed RB monster of Henry, Jacobs, and Kyren Williams combined for 55.6 points, and the group chat is doing that thing where they pretend they saw this coming.

Turns out, you don't need receivers when your quarterback IS the offense. De'Von Achane chipped in 16.0 and Bucky Irving added 12.5 — the rookie RB committee doing exactly what we hoped. You beat Noble FFT by 11.14 points, and if Allen plays anywhere near this level consistently, the 'stuck in fifth' narrative dies. The question remains: what happens when Allen has a 15-point week and your receivers have to carry the load? We both know the answer."

We said your ceiling was 'drywall' in the preseason. Drywall that wins games is still drywall that wins games. Runner-up in 2022, runner-up in 2023, champion in 2024, and now a solid Week 1.

In the group chat you're 'often the instigator of side bets and polls,' so we imagine you've already started a poll asking whether the preseason rankings should be burned. Fair point. One week doesn't make a season, but 144.36 points is a statement. Maybe those age cliffs have guardrails after all."

Saquon Barkley delivered 16.4 and CeeDee Lamb added 14.5, but Drake Maye at quarterback only managed 15.28, and the roster that 'reads like the All-Pro team' looked more like the All-Adequate team.

The 2022 champion is still alive, the Voltron receivers didn't need to assemble, and Mahomes did Mahomes things. Your tight-end room is still a ghost town — Hunter Henry exists in the way a participation trophy exists — but hey, you're 1-0. Next week you face a Ghastly team that just got embarrassed.

Nothing went wrong, actually — Jayden Daniels scored 20.12, Myles Garrett had 22.0 on defense, and even the patchwork running backs showed up (Chuba Hubbard: 16.4). You were the second-highest-scoring losing team in Week 1, which is dynasty football's version of 'the food was great but the restaurant burned down.'

Ashton Jeanty only managed 11.0, and the 'best young RB duo in the league' looked more like one good RB and one guy figuring out the NFL. We said you were 'playing for 2026.'

That's the Josh Allen problem: you can do everything right and still lose because one quarterback decided to play like a video game. We wrote that you needed 'an elite tight end and a little receiver depth.' After Week 1, add 'divine intervention against Josh Allen' to that list. You face Kittler next.

We said you were 'a classic spoiler who knocks contenders out of the playoffs but never raises the trophy.' Week 1 didn't do anything to change that narrative.

      "answer": "By playing against a team that scores 151. That's the cruel math of fantasy football — there's no moral victory for second-highest score of the week. You lose 0-1 the same way someone who scored 90 loses 0-1. The universe doesn't grade on a curve. But if it makes you feel better, your 142.62 would have won against every other team in the league this week. That probably doesn't make you feel better."

It's one week. Ask me again in Week 6 when we have actual sample sizes. But for now, it's a useful reminder that preseason rankings are built on projections and vibes, and vibes don't block for your running back."

      "answer": "It's too early to panic about anything. It's Week 1. Stroud had 9.72 points, which is bad, but Tom Brady once threw for 123 yards in a game and then won six Super Bowls. Bad weeks happen. However — and I say this with love — your team scored 109.42 points total. That's not a Stroud problem. That's an everything problem. Those draft picks need to start converting into actual fantasy-relevant football players, or we're having this same conversation in Week 14."

      "question": "Dear Expert: The Boonist Monks were ranked last in the preseason and just put up 144. Should we burn the preseason rankings?",
      "answer": "No, but you should laminate them for reference. Lamar Jackson went for 29.36, James Cook had 18.7, and the 'aging core approaching age cliffs' looked like they were approaching the summit instead. One week doesn't invalidate a preseason projection, but it does make excellent group chat ammunition. GauchoTrain has probably already screenshotted the preseason essay and is drafting his response."
