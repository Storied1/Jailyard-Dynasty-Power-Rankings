  "essay": "Josh Allen dropped 38.76 points and somewhere in the group chat, @ToreroGaucho posted a single fire emoji \u2014 no caption, no context, just the quiet confidence of a man whose quarterback just turned a Week 1 matchup into a formality. The 2025 season is here, and the preseason power rankings lasted about as long as a Bryce Young starting job.\n\nThe numbers don\u2019t lie, but they do love irony. We spent all offseason building a meticulous ranking system \u2014 40% win percentage, 30% points for, 20% recent form, 10% strength of schedule \u2014 and the football gods responded by flipping the whole thing upside down like a snow globe. The preseason top three went a combined 1-2. The bottom two? Both won. Your carefully curated tiers? Already on fire.\n\nStart with the Sleeping Giants, ranked eleventh coming in and currently sitting at number one after dropping 151.48 points on MHJTIME\u2019s head. We said your WRs peaked when Fortnite did. We said Derrick Henry and Josh Jacobs had too many career carries. Henry heard us, apparently, because he responded with a 28.7-point performance that suggested the only thing aging about him is his wine collection. Jalen Hurts added 24.28, and suddenly the Island of Misfit WR1s looks more like a private island with bottle service.\n\nThen there\u2019s the Boonist Monks \u2014 preseason dead last, Week 1 power rank fourth \u2014 who beat Ghastly Grayskull Gang by a casual 34.94 points. That\u2019s not a margin of victory; that\u2019s a restraining order. Lamar Jackson went full video-game mode with 29.36, James Cook contributed 18.7, and @GauchoTrain \u2014 the league\u2019s self-appointed instigator of side bets and polls \u2014 is absolutely lighting up the group chat right now with receipts. Remember when we said your team could win it all or retire it all? Week 1 chose violence.\n\nMeanwhile, Noble FFT \u2014 your preseason number two, the team with the league\u2019s scariest backfield \u2014 lost to Rasheeing the Scene by 11.14 points despite Bijan Robinson\u2019s 21.4. Josh Allen\u2019s 38.76 simply doesn\u2019t care about your scouting report. And MHJTIME, our preseason three, put up 142.62 points and still lost. In most leagues, that total wins comfortably. In the Jailyard, that\u2019s a cruel lesson about the schedule gods.\n\nSo what do we actually know after one week? That Derrick Henry isn\u2019t done. That Lamar Jackson is still a cheat code. That Josh Allen might be illegal. And that preseason rankings are suggestions, not prophecies.\n\nThe group chat has been insufferable since Sunday. The rebuilders are talking trash. The contenders are recalculating. Somewhere, @Chudders is icing another trade offer and smirking.\n\nOne week in and nothing makes sense. That\u2019s exactly how dynasty should feel.",
