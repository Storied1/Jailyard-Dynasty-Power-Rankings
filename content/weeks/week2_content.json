  "essay": "Sixty-nine point nine. That\u2019s not a margin of victory \u2014 that\u2019s the kind of number that makes the group chat go silent for three full minutes before someone types \u201cbro\u201d in all lowercase. The Boonist Monks \u2014 preseason dead last, the franchise we described as \u201ccould win it all or retire it all\u201d \u2014 just obliterated Burden of Etienne-y Woody 168.7 to 98.8, and somehow that wasn\u2019t even the most interesting thing that happened in Week 2.\n\nBecause while @GauchoTrain was busy conducting a one-sided demolition derby, MHJTIME quietly put up 182.8 points \u2014 the highest single-week score of the young season \u2014 and the group chat barely flinched. Malik Nabers exploded for 34.2. Ja\u2019Marr Chase added 30.5. Jayden Daniels pitched in 19.7. We called that WR trio \u201chistoric\u201d in the preseason, and two weeks in, the word feels undersized. The problem? After losing Week 1 with 142.62 despite doing everything right, MHJTIME is only 1-1 \u2014 and leads the league in total points at 325.4. That\u2019s the dynasty equivalent of batting .400 and your team being .500.\n\nThe symmetry of suffering is almost poetic this week. Remember how MHJTIME scored 142 in Week 1 and lost to the one opponent who went off? Father Time just lived the exact same nightmare \u2014 dropped 165.06 behind Jared Goff\u2019s 33.96 and Roquan Smith\u2019s 26.5, and still lost because MHJTIME\u2019s ceiling is apparently located in outer space. The preseason essay warned that the chat would love Father Time\u2019s random 180-point weeks and ignore the rest. At 0-2 with 165.06 this week, the rest is all there is.\n\nThen there\u2019s the free fall. One week ago, the Sleeping Giants sat atop these power rankings \u2014 the feel-good story, the aging roster that refused to age, Derrick Henry\u2019s 28.7-point proclamation that the clock hadn\u2019t struck midnight yet. Seven days later? A 32.66-point loss to General Ken-obi, a kicker (Brandon Aubrey at 24.5) leading the scoring column, and a six-spot tumble to seventh. We said they were playing on borrowed time. Turns out the loan shark came early.\n\nThe real story of Week 2 might be what\u2019s crystallizing at the top. Five teams sit at 2-0 \u2014 the Boonist Monks, Kittler on the Roof, General Ken-obi, the Legion of Bouz, and Rasheeing the Scene. Five more are winless. Only MHJTIME and the Sleeping Giants occupy the messy middle at 1-1, and one of them has more points than anyone. The league has split cleanly into haves and have-nots after fourteen days, and the group chat\u2019s power rankings discourse has already reached \u201cwell actually\u201d levels of intensity.\n\nGeneral Ken-obi \u2014 your preseason number one, the team everyone measured themselves against \u2014 is quietly doing exactly what preseason favorites are supposed to do. Drake Maye\u2019s 26.3, Kenneth Walker\u2019s 18.3, CeeDee Lamb\u2019s 16.7. No drama. No fireworks. Just wins. Two of them.\n\nTwo weeks down, twelve to go. The preseason bottom-dweller is the new number one. The preseason darling is licking its wounds at seventh. The league\u2019s best scorer can\u2019t buy a second win. And somewhere in the group chat, someone is already typing a four-paragraph essay about why their 0-2 team is \u201cactually fine.\u201d\n\nDynasty is chaos theory with a waiver wire. Act accordingly.",

The Legion counters with Amon-Ra St. Brown\u2019s 34.7-point eruption and McCaffrey\u2019s steady floor. Lamar vs. the Voltron receivers. Monks by a nose \u2014 momentum is a real thing until it isn\u2019t."
