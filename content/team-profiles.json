Jalen Hurts is a cheat code, and Jordan Addison appears ready to claim a bigger role opposite Cooper Kupp and Keenan Allen. Your weekly projection around 45 points and one of the league\u2019s softest schedules suggest you\u2019re fighting uphill. You\u2019ve reached a championship (2024) and a semifinal in the last three seasons; if the veterans hold up you could sneak into the playoffs again. If not, trade those names and embrace the rebuild\u2014before the chat starts calling you the \u201cIsland of Misfit WR1s\u201d again.",

Lamar Jackson, Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce are still video-game characters, but all three are approaching age cliffs. James Cook and David Montgomery provide steady RB production and Zay Flowers could ascend. Projected weekly points around 47 put you in contention and your schedule is favourable, but your lack of picks makes retooling tricky. In the group chat you\u2019re often the instigator of side bets and polls; 2025 might be the season when you push all your chips in for one last run before selling the farm.",
