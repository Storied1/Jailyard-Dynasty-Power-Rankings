  "essay": "The 2026 offseason hit The Jailyard like a freight train nobody ordered.\n\n{{media:preseason-2026-essay-opener}}\n\nThree blockbuster trades, two retirements, and a rookie draft class that has the group chat divided into warring factions. Welcome to the most chaotic preseason in Jailyard history.\n\nKittler on the Roof defends a title won on the backs of Joe Burrow and Puka Nacua, but the rest of the league isn\u2019t sitting still. General Ken\u2011obi reloaded at quarterback. MHJTIME finally addressed the running back problem that\u2019s haunted them for two years. The Boonist Monks went full scorched earth, trading Tyreek Hill for a haul of picks that had the group chat typing in all caps for forty-five minutes straight.\n\n{{media:preseason-2026-mid-essay}}\n\nChudders Football Team is the story nobody saw coming: two years of tanking, a mountain of draft capital, and suddenly a roster that looks like it was assembled by a kid with unlimited Madden trade override. Ghastly Grayskull Gang finally found a receiver room that doesn\u2019t make you squint. And somewhere in the middle, Rasheeing the Scene is still doing Rasheeing the Scene things \u2014 scoring 180 one week, 90 the next, and blaming the schedule both times.\n\nIf last season taught us anything, it\u2019s that preseason rankings are suggestions written in pencil. The football gods use a Sharpie.",
